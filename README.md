# Just In Time Ordering Kata

## Context

For this exercise, you are a storefront that orders from a distributor to collect and deliver products to customers on a specific date. Your storefront uses just-in-time ordering to minimize warehousing costs. It takes one day for the storefront to provide products from its warehouse to the customer.

**Manufacturer A** sells **blue widgets** and delivers within **two to three business days**. Per your contract with this manufacturer, the storefront can only order on **Tuesdays**.

**Manufacturer B** sells **green widgets** and has **next-day delivery**. Per your contract with this manufacturer, the storefront can only order on **Fridays**.

**Manufacturer C** sells **red widgets** and delivers in **five to seven business days**. You have no contract with this manufacturer to order **daily** from the storefront.
